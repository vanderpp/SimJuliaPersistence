# SimJuliaPersistence
Simulation software users run simulated models to decide on problems that are generally too difficult to solve analytically. The probabilistic elements in such simulations necessitate multiple runs, which in turn generate data. This data is of key importance for the user since it is used to decide upon the questions the simulations were run for in the first place. To enable transcendence in time and space for this data, the requirement for the end user to be familiar with persistence technology is of utmost importance, but not always present. In this work, we present a solution to this contradiction. We present a novel transparent data persistence architecture as an extension of the ConcurrentSim package. We integrated PostgresORM.jl into the ResumableFunctions.jl and ConcurrentSim.jl packages by using Julia's metaprogramming support. As such, we were able to remove the dependency on a user's knowledge on architectures for persistence. Furthermore, we implemented two distinct approaches to externalise the data. The first one is oriented towards a REST API, which can be consumed by existing frameworks and application templates. The second one integrates our dynamic object-relational mapping (ORM) in the existing VueJS.jl package.  Our contribution aims to improve the usability of the ConcurrentSim ecosystem, whilst demonstrating the power of macro expansion to move towards a dynamic ORM configuration.
